# 🎉 Project Successfully Migrated to UV!

## Summary

The **Power & Gas Trader Shift Handover System** has been successfully migrated from pip to **uv** for ultrafast package management.

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. Created `pyproject.toml`
Replaced `requirements.txt` with a modern `pyproject.toml` containing:
- Project metadata
- Core dependencies (streamlit, pandas)
- Dev dependencies (pytest, pytest-cov)
- Test configuration
- Build system configuration

### 2. Updated Documentation
- **AGENTS.md**: Added uv as required package manager with benefits explanation
- **README.md**: Updated all installation and usage instructions to use uv
- **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md**: Updated all command examples
- **start.bat**: Modified to use uv commands
- Created **UV_MIGRATION.md**: Migration documentation

### 3. Removed Old Files
- ❌ Deleted `requirements.txt` (no longer needed)

### 4. Created Virtual Environment
- ✅ Created `.venv` using `uv venv`
- ✅ Installed all 45 packages successfully
- ✅ Verified installation works

## 📦 Package Management with UV

### Why UV?
- **10-100x faster** than pip
- Better dependency resolution
- Written in Rust for performance
- Drop-in pip replacement

### Key Commands

```cmd
REM Create virtual environment
uv venv

REM Install dependencies
uv pip install -e .

REM Install with dev dependencies (for testing)
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

REM Run the app
uv run streamlit run app.py
```

## 🚀 Running the Application

### Easiest Method: Use the start script
```cmd
cd d:\SB_MICROHACK\hackathon
start.bat
```

This will:
1. Create `.venv` if it doesn't exist
2. Install all dependencies with uv
3. Activate the virtual environment
4. Start the Streamlit application

### Manual Method:
```cmd
cd d:\SB_MICROHACK\hackathon

REM First time setup
uv venv
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

REM Every time you run
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🧪 Testing

```cmd
REM Activate virtual environment
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

REM Run all tests
pytest

REM Run with coverage
pytest --cov=database --cov=utils --cov-report=html

REM View coverage
start htmlcov\index.html
```
