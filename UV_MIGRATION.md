# ✅ Migration to UV Complete!

## Changes Made

The project has been successfully migrated from `pip` to `uv` for faster package management.

### Files Changed:

1. **`pyproject.toml`** (NEW) - Replaces `requirements.txt`
   - Defines project dependencies
   - Includes dev dependencies (pytest, pytest-cov)
   - Configured for hatchling build system

2. **`requirements.txt`** (DELETED) - No longer needed

3. **`AGENTS.md`** (UPDATED)
   - Added uv as the package manager requirement
   - Added Package Management section explaining uv usage

4. **`README.md`** (UPDATED)
   - All command examples now use `uv` instead of `pip`
   - Updated installation instructions
   - Updated testing instructions
   - Changed shell examples to PowerShell

5. **`start.bat`** (UPDATED)
   - Now uses `uv venv` instead of `python -m venv`
   - Uses `uv pip install` for dependencies
   - Targets the `.venv` virtual environment correctly

6. **`PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`** (UPDATED)
   - Updated all instructions to use uv
   - Changed command examples to PowerShell syntax

## ✅ Installation Verified

Successfully installed all dependencies using uv:
- streamlit==1.50.0
- pandas==2.3.3
- pytest==8.4.2
- pytest-cov==7.0.0
- Plus all 45 dependencies

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the start script
```powershell
.\start.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual setup
```powershell
# Create virtual environment
uv venv

# Install dependencies
uv pip install --python .venv -e ".[dev]"

# Activate and run
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
streamlit run app.py
```

### Option 3: Direct run with uv
```powershell
# Install first
uv pip install --python .venv -e .

# Run with uv
uv run --python .venv streamlit run app.py
```

## 📊 Benefits of UV

- **Faster**: 10-100x faster than pip
- **Reliable**: Better dependency resolution
- **Modern**: Written in Rust
- **Compatible**: Drop-in replacement for pip

## 🧪 Running Tests

```powershell
# Make sure dev dependencies are installed
uv pip install --python .venv -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pytest

# Or with coverage
pytest --cov=database --cov=utils --cov-report=html
```

## 📝 Notes

- Virtual environment is now `.venv` (uv default) instead of `venv`
- All Python dependencies are managed in `pyproject.toml`
- Dev dependencies (pytest) are optional and installed with `.[dev]`
- The project is installed in editable mode with `-e` flag

## ✨ Ready to Use!

The project is fully configured and ready to run with uv. Simply execute:

```powershell
.\start.bat
```

And you're up and running! 🎉
