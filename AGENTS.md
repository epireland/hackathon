- **Description**: Web application for Power and Gas traders to create shift handover log

## Requirements
- **Functional Requirements:**
  **Core Handover Management:**
  - Allow traders to log shift handover details including trader name, shift date, and notes.
  - Provide a view to list all handover logs.
  - Enable editing and deleting of existing handover logs.
  
  **Trading Positions & Market Activity:**
  - **Power Position**: Display current power trading positions and portfolio status.
  - **Gas Position**: Display current gas trading positions and portfolio status.
  - **Competitor Activity**: Log and monitor competitor activities in the market.
  
  **Operational Status & Infrastructure:**
  - **Plant Status**: Track and display the operational status of power and gas plants.
  - **Power System Status**: Monitor and display the status of the power system infrastructure.
  
  **Issues & Alerts:**
  - **Notifications**: Allow traders to create and view notifications for important alerts.
  - **IT Issues**: Record and track IT-related issues affecting trading operations.
  
  **General Communication:**
  - **Comments**: Enable traders to add general comments and observations during their shift.

  **Testing:**
  - Implement comprehensive unit tests for all core functionality.
  - Test coverage should include CRUD operations, and database interactions.
  - Use pytest or unittest framework for test implementation.
  - Aim for minimum 80% code coverage.

- **Non-functional Requirements:**
  - Ensure the application is responsive and works on desktop and tablet devices.
  - Use SQLite as the database for simplicity and portability.

## Deliverables
- **Milestones:**
  - Database schema design and setup.
  - Streamlit application with CRUD functionality.
  - Deployment and user testing.
- **Expected Outputs:**
  - A minimum viable product (MVP) web application for shift handover management.

## Resources
